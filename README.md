NIGHTGUARD: Empowering Womenâ€™s Safety with Night Patrolling Robot
Introduction:
NIGHTGUARD is a project aimed at enhancing women's safety through the implementation of a night patrolling robot. This README provides an overview of the project, its functionalities, and instructions for setup and usage.

Features:
Autonomous patrolling: The robot is capable of autonomously navigating predefined paths to patrol designated areas.
Surveillance: Equipped with cameras and sensors, NIGHTGUARD can detect and capture suspicious activities or intrusions.
Alert system: In case of emergencies or security breaches, the robot sends immediate alerts to authorities or designated contacts.
Components:
Arduino Uno: Acts as the main microcontroller for controlling the robot's movements and functionalities.
Ultrasonic sensors: Used for obstacle detection and avoidance during patrolling.
Camera module: Provides visual surveillance capabilities.
GSM module: Enables communication and alerting functionalities.
Motor drivers: Control the movement of motors for navigating the robot.
Setup:
Connect the components according to the provided circuit diagram.
Install the necessary libraries for Arduino programming.
Upload the Arduino sketch provided in the 'src' directory to the Arduino Uno.
Configure the GSM module with appropriate SIM card settings.
Power up the robot and ensure all systems are functioning correctly.
Usage:
Place the robot in the designated patrolling area.
Power on the robot and initiate the patrol mode.
Monitor the surveillance feed remotely via the designated interface.
In case of any suspicious activities or emergencies, receive immediate alerts and take appropriate action.
